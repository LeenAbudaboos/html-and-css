    <p>The Wikipedia project began on January 15, 2001 as a complement to the Nupedia project, written by expert editors. Because of the slow development of Nupedia, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger decided to create an open project to support Nupedia, which is Wikipedia.

        It now contains 600,000 articles in English and 2 million articles in other languages combined, according to what Jimmy Willis mentioned. Major languages such as German, Japanese, French, and Western European languages are also large. Only a third of visits are in English, contrary to what some people think, and the extent of Wikipedia’s popularity is that it is one of the 50 largest sites in the world. There were many visits to the pages, like visits to the pages of the New York Times. The New York Times and other sites have employees responsible for the site, many of whom receive salaries. As for Wikipedia, there is only one who is the developer of the program itself and has been appointed since January 2005. The servers are managed by volunteers and editing is also done by volunteers.
        
        Nupedia
        Main article: Nupedia
        
        Nupedia logo, the free encyclopedia formerly of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is run by a group of volunteers, including a group of software developers working on MediaWiki.
        Other collaborative online encyclopedias had been attempted before Wikipedia, but none were successful.
        
        Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. It was established on March 9, 2000, and is owned by Bomis, an online portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its Nupedia Free Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the request of Richard Stallman. Wells is credited with setting the goal of creating an editable public encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using wikis to reach this goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger suggested on the Nupedia mailing list that a wiki be created as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.
        
        Launch and early growth
        The domains Wikipedia.com and Wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001, and January 13, 2001, respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English language edition at www.Wikipedia.com, and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list . Wikipedia's "neutral point of view" policy was codified in its first few months. Other than that, there were relatively few rules at first and Wikipedia operated independently from Nupedia. Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a for-profit company.

        Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot publications, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 editions by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were permanently removed in 2003, and its text was merged into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the two million article mark on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever compiled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which held the record for nearly 600 years.
        
        Citing concerns about commercial advertising and a lack of control in Wikipedia, Spanish Wikipedia users forked from Wikipedia to create the free encyclopedia in Spanish in February 2002. Wales subsequently announced that Wikipedia would no longer display advertising, and changed Wikipedia's domain from Wikipedia.com to Wikipedia.org.
        
        Although the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the number of new articles and contributors, appears to have peaked in early 2007. About 1,800 articles per day were added to the encyclopedia in 2006; By 2013 this average was about 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowdown in growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. Others suggest that growth occurs naturally because articles that might be called “low-hanging fruit”—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built at scale.
        
        In November 2009, a researcher at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; By comparison, the project lost just 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. The Wall Street Journal cited a set of rules applied to editing and disputes over such content among the reasons for the trend. Wells disputed the claims in 2009, denying the retraction and questioning the study's methodology. Two years later, in 2011, Wells acknowledged a slight decline, citing a decline from "just over 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wells also claimed that the number of editors was "stable and sustainable". A 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" in MIT Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia has lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there are increasingly focused on detail. In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of officials was also declining. In the November 25, 2013 issue of New York Magazine, Katherine Ward stated that "Wikipedia, the sixth most widely used site, is facing an internal crisis."</p>
